As moms, we are busy taking care of others, so the advice we’ve been receiving is to prioritize <br\/>Self care. But what is Self care? While the intention behind the word is good, the term Self care has been hijacked to sell products designed to create an unrealistic zen that we will forever be chasing. <br\/><br\/>True self-care is not salt baths and candles, it is making a daily choice to do things that contribute to our long-term well-being. It’s when we stop chasing perfection, and do things which actually give us internal strength to handle everything that comes our way. We knew quick self-care hacks didn’t work for moms. That’s why we created CBD for moms: to help all women reach the long-term wellness.<br\/><br\/>Sonya T. CEO<\/p>"
